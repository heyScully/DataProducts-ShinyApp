This is a super-simple Shiny app that allows you to  display a plot of age (in days) against trunk circumference (in mm) for orange trees. Simply select one of the five trees displayed in the app, and the plot will update with the data for that tree. The data used for this project is the 'Orange' data set in the 'datasets' package.
